## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open an issue to report vulnerabilities as this will make it public 
for others to exploit. If you have found something that can be considered a 
security risk, send me an email at `kennylajara+vulnerability[at-dont-spam-me]gmail.com`.

Be sure to email me ONLY about a security issue. Other types of emails will 
likely be ignored and receive no response.
